Notice To Packagers
-------------------

Please do not package this extension.


Version
-------

v1.0   11/1/2011


Purpose:
--------

Demostrate how to create a simple menu for the GNOME 3.2
Shell.


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called demo@fpmurphy.com
should be created. 

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the 
extension using: 

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -e demo@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -d demo@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension. 

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.
